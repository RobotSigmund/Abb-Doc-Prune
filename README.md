# Abb-Doc-Prune

Prune non essential language files and patch index file.

Copy the Perlscript into the docs folder. Run it, and it will delete files using languages other than english and swedish. Total size will be reduced to around 15-20%.

This works fine with documentation package for IRC5 and Omnicore.
